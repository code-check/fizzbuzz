## FizzBuzz

Write a function to implement FizzBuzz Logic.

## Challenge Description
- *Use [fizzbuzz.cpp](https://github.com/code-check/fizzbuzz/blob/c%2B%2B/app/fizzbuzz.cpp) for solving the challenge*
- *See [fizzbuzztest.js](https://github.com/code-check/fizzbuzz/blob/c%2B%2B/test/fizzbuzztest.js) for seeing the tests*
- FizzBuzz Logic,
  - If the number is
    - Divisible by ` 3 `  replace it with ` "Fizz" `
    - Divisible by ` 5 `  replace it with ` "Buzz" `
    - Divisible by ` 15 ` replace it with ` "FizzBuzz" `
    - Not Divisible by ` 3, 5 or 15 ` do not change

### Example

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Input</b></td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Output</b></td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Fizz</td>
    <td>Buzz</td>
    <td>FizzBuzz</td>
  </tr>
</table>
