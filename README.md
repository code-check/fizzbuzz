### Run Tests
- If you are solving the test locally please install codecheck globally by running the following command in terminal
```
$ npm install codecheck -g 
```
- Now run `codecheck` command in terminal in the root folder of challenge
- If you are solving it on Web editor please run `codecheck` command to see the test status.
```
$ codecheck
```
- Initially all the tests will fail with following output
```
codecheck: Finish with code 100
codecheck: tests  : 100
codecheck: success: 0
codecheck: failure: 100
```
- Solve the challenge to pass the tests
```
codecheck: Finish with code 0
codecheck: tests  : 100
codecheck: success: 100
codecheck: failure: 0
```
